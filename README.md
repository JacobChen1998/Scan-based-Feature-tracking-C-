# Scan-based-Feature-tracking (C++)-
This is the new repository that is same concept as my previous project " Feature-tracking-with-PCA " but be written in C++.
Here I try to remove PCA first since that When I try to use PCA function supported by OpenCV, it taken such long time. Therefore, I just remove PCA first. For future, the Lucas-Kanade based self-adaptive function will be added, too.
